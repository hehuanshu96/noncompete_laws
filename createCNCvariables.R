# Assign non-compete status by state-year.

# Code assumes that the user's state-level data is already loaded. 

# Usage:
#  source("createCNCvariables.R")
#  'data' has field "state" and "year".  State is a string, not a factor. 
#	  data2 <- updateLawChange(data, "state", "year")
# data2 now has two new fields `cncChange' and `note_LawChange`


# Result: Creates 

#  `cncChange` = {-1,1} for the direction of the change in the law
# -1 --> weak
# 1 --> strong
# `note_LawChange' = Short desc. if debate or differ from Ewens and Marx

# as new variables in your data frame.
